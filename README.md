# Deep Reinforcement Learning based Computation Offloading in a Multi User Multi Fog Environment

A multi-User multi-fog computing environment is proposed for offloading the resource-intensive computational task. Reinforcement learning algorithms(Q-learning, Expected-SARSA, Actor critic, Actor critic with entropy) are used to analyze which algorithm takes the offloading decision efficiently by minimizing the task offloading delay.

Python, SImpy, Keras, Tensorflow are used for simulation.

The simulation results show that the proposed Actor-Critic(with entropy or without entropy) RL based decision process performs better than the other algorithms
